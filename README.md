[![Latest](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/navidrome/discord-rich-presence-plugin)](https://github.com/navidrome/discord-rich-presence-plugin/releases/latest/download/discord-rich-presence.ndp)

**Attention: This version (2.0.0-beta) requires a development build of Navidrome with PlaybackReport support ([navidrome/navidrome#5452](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/pull/5452)). It will not work with any released version of Navidrome.**

**For Navidrome 0.61.x, use [plugin v1.0.0](https://github.com/navidrome/discord-rich-presence-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0).**

This plugin integrates Navidrome with Discord Rich Presence, displaying your currently playing track in your Discord status. 
The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of Navidrome's plugin system by implementing a real-time presence feature using Discord's Gateway API.
It demonstrates how a Navidrome plugin can maintain real-time connections to external services while remaining completely stateless. 

Based on the [Navicord](https://github.com/logixism/navicord) project.

**⚠️ WARNING: This plugin requires storing Discord user tokens, which may violate Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.**

## Features

- Shows currently playing track with title, artist, and album art
- Pause state with pause icon overlay and "paused for" elapsed timer
- Playback rate-aware timestamps (correct elapsed/remaining for audiobooks at 2x, etc.)
- Clickable track title and artist name link to Spotify (direct track link via [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org), falls back to Spotify search)
- Clickable album art links to the Spotify track page
- Customizable activity name: "Navidrome" is default, but can be configured to display track title, artist, or album
- Displays playback progress with start/end timestamps
- Automatic presence clearing when playback stops
- Multi-user support with individual Discord tokens
- Optional album art from [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org) for MusicBrainz-tagged music
- Optional image hosting via [uguu.se](https://uguu.se) for non-public Navidrome instances

## Installation

### Step 1: Download and Install the Plugin
1. Download the `discord-rich-presence.ndp` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/navidrome/discord-rich-presence-plugin/releases)
2. Copy it to your Navidrome plugins folder. Default location: `<navidrome-data-directory>/plugins/`

### Step 2: Create a Discord Application
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name (e.g., "My Navidrome")
3. Note down the **Application ID** (Client ID) - you'll need this for configuration

### Step 3: Get Your Discord User Token
⚠️ **WARNING**: This step involves using your Discord user token, which may violate Discord's Terms of Service. Proceed at your own risk.

We don't provide instructions for obtaining the token as it may violate Discord's policies. You can find guides online by searching for "how to get Discord user token".

### Step 4: Configure the Plugin
1. Open Navidrome and go to **Settings > Plugins > Discord Rich Presence**
2. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Client ID**: Your Discord Application ID from Step 2
    - **Activity Name Display**: Choose what to show as the activity name (Default, Track, Album, Artist)
      - "Default" is recommended to help spread awareness of your favorite music server 😉, but feel free to choose the option that best suits your preferences
   - **Use artwork from Cover Art Archive**: Enable this if your music has MusicBrainz tags (see Album Art section below)
   - **Upload to uguu.se**: Enable this if your Navidrome isn't publicly accessible (see Album Art section below)
   - **Enable Spotify link-through**: Enable this to make track title and album art clickable links to Spotify
   - **Users**: Add your Navidrome username and Discord token from Step 3

### Step 5: Enable Discord Activity Sharing
In Discord, ensure your activity is visible to others:
1. Go to **User Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to **Activity Privacy**
3. Enable **"Display current activity as a status message"**

### Step 6: Enable the Plugin
1. In Navidrome's plugin settings, toggle the plugin to **Enabled**
2. No restart required - check Navidrome logs for any initialization errors

## Album Art Display

For album artwork to display in Discord, Discord needs to be able to access the image. Choose one of these options:

### Option 1: Public Navidrome Instance
**Use this if**: Your Navidrome server can be reached from the internet

**Setup**:
1. Set the `ND_BASEURL` environment variable to your public URL:
   ```bash
   # Example for Docker or Docker Compose
   ND_BASEURL=https://music.yourdomain.com
   
   # Example for navidrome.toml
   BaseURL = "https://music.yourdomain.com"
   ```
2. **Restart Navidrome** (required for ND_BASEURL changes)
3. In plugin settings: **Disable** "Upload to uguu.se"

### Option 2: Cover Art Archive (for MusicBrainz-tagged music)
**Use this if**: Your music is tagged with MusicBrainz IDs

**Setup**:
1. In plugin settings: **Enable** "Use artwork from Cover Art Archive"
2. No other configuration needed

**How it works**: The plugin checks the [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org) for album artwork using the track's MusicBrainz Release ID. If the specific release has no art, it falls back to the Release Group (which finds art from any edition of the same album). The resolved image URL is passed directly to Discord — no upload needed. Results are cached for 24 hours.

**Note**: This option takes priority over uguu.se and direct Navidrome URLs when enabled. It only works for tracks that have MusicBrainz IDs in their metadata — tracks without IDs will fall through to the next method.

### Option 3: Private Instance with uguu.se Upload
**Use this if**: Your Navidrome is only accessible locally (home network, behind VPN, etc.)

**Setup**:
1. In plugin settings: **Enable** "Upload to uguu.se"
2. No other configuration needed

**How it works**: Album art is automatically uploaded to uguu.se (temporary, anonymous hosting service) so Discord can access it. Files are deleted after 3 hours.

### Troubleshooting Album Art
- **No album art showing**: Check Navidrome logs for errors
- **Using public instance**: Verify ND_BASEURL is correct and Navidrome was restarted
- **Using Cover Art Archive**: Verify your music has MusicBrainz IDs (check file tags for `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID`)
- **Using uguu.se**: Check that the option is enabled and your server has internet access

## Configuration

Access the plugin configuration in Navidrome: **Settings > Plugins > Discord Rich Presence**

<img alt="Plugin configuration panel showing all available settings" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navidrome/discord-rich-presence-plugin/master/.github/ss-config.webp">

### Configuration Fields

#### Client ID
- **What it is**: Your Discord Application ID
- **How to get it**: 
  1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  2. Create a new application or select an existing one
  3. Copy the "Application ID" from the General Information page
- **Example**: `1234567890123456789`

#### Activity Name Display
- **What it is**: Choose what information to display as the activity name in Discord Rich Presence
- **Options**:
  - **Default**: Shows "Navidrome" (static app name)
  - **Track**: Shows the currently playing track title
  - **Album**: Shows the currently playing track's album name
  - **Artist**: Shows the currently playing track's artist name
  - **Custom**: Uses a template string with placeholders (see **Custom Activity Name Template** below)

#### Custom Activity Name Template
- **What it is**: A template string used when Activity Name Display is set to **Custom**
- **Default**: `{artist} - {track}`
- **Available placeholders**:
  - `{track}` — The track title
  - `{artist}` — The track's primary artist name
  - `{artists}` — All track artists joined with ` • ` (e.g., `Borgore • Miley Cyrus`). Falls back to the value of `{artist}` when individual artist metadata is unavailable.
  - `{album}` — The album name

#### Use artwork from Cover Art Archive
- **When to enable**: Your music is tagged with MusicBrainz IDs and you want album art from the Cover Art Archive
- **What it does**: Checks the [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org) for artwork using MusicBrainz Release ID, with a fallback to Release Group ID. Takes priority over other artwork methods when enabled.
- **When to disable**: Your music isn't tagged with MusicBrainz IDs

#### Upload to uguu.se
- **When to enable**: Your Navidrome instance is NOT publicly accessible from the internet
- **What it does**: Automatically uploads album artwork to uguu.se (temporary hosting) so Discord can display it
- **When to disable**: Your Navidrome is publicly accessible and you've set `ND_BASEURL`

#### Enable Spotify Link-through
- **Default**: Disabled
- **What it does**: When enabled, clicking the track title or album art in Discord opens the corresponding Spotify page
- **How it works**: Track URLs are resolved via [ListenBrainz Labs](https://labs.api.listenbrainz.org) for direct Spotify links, falling back to Spotify search when no match is found

#### Users
Add each Navidrome user who wants Discord Rich Presence. For each user, provide:
- **Username**: The Navidrome login username (case-sensitive)
- **Token**: The Discord user token (see Step 3 in Installation for how to obtain this)

## How It Works

### Plugin Capabilities

The plugin implements three Navidrome capabilities:

| Capability            | Purpose                                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scrobbler**         | Receives `PlaybackReport` events for play/pause/stop state changes           |
| **WebSocketCallback** | Handles incoming Discord gateway messages (heartbeat ACKs, sequence numbers) |
| **SchedulerCallback** | Processes scheduled heartbeat events                                         |

### Host Services

| Service         | Usage                                                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP**        | Discord API calls (gateway discovery, external assets registration), Cover Art Archive lookups, ListenBrainz Spotify resolution |
| **WebSocket**   | Persistent connection to Discord gateway                                                             |
| **Cache**       | Sequence numbers, processed image URLs, resolved Spotify URLs                                        |
| **Scheduler**   | Recurring heartbeats                                                                                 |
| **Artwork**     | Track artwork public URL resolution                                                                  |
| **SubsonicAPI** | Fetches track artwork data for image hosting upload                                                  |

### Flow

1. **Playback starts** — Navidrome sends a `PlaybackReport` with state `playing`
2. **Plugin connects** — If not already connected, establishes WebSocket to Discord gateway
3. **Authentication** — Sends identify payload with user's Discord token
4. **Presence update** — Sends activity with track info, timestamps, and processed artwork URL
5. **Heartbeat loop** — Recurring scheduler sends heartbeats every 41 seconds to keep connection alive
6. **Playback paused** — `PlaybackReport` with state `paused` updates presence with pause icon and "paused for" timer
7. **Playback resumed** — `PlaybackReport` with state `playing` restores running timestamps
8. **Playback stopped** — `PlaybackReport` with state `stopped` or `expired` clears presence and disconnects

### Stateless Design

Navidrome plugins are stateless - each call creates a fresh instance. This plugin handles that by:

- **WebSocket connections**: Managed by host, keyed by username
- **Sequence numbers**: Stored in cache for heartbeat messages
- **Configuration**: Reloaded on every method call
- **Artwork URLs**: Cached after processing through Discord's external assets API

### Image Processing

Discord requires images to be registered via their external assets API. The plugin resolves artwork URLs using a priority chain:

1. **Cover Art Archive** (if enabled): HEAD request to check for artwork by MusicBrainz Release ID, with fallback to Release Group ID. The resolved `archive.org` URL is used directly.
2. **uguu.se** (if enabled): Fetches artwork from Navidrome and uploads to temporary hosting.
3. **Direct URL**: Uses the Navidrome artwork URL directly (requires public instance).

The resolved URL is then registered with Discord's external assets API to get an `mp:` prefixed URL, which is cached (4 hours for track art, 48 hours for default image). Falls back to a default image if artwork is unavailable.

### Spotify Linking

The plugin enriches the Discord presence with clickable Spotify links so others can easily find what you're listening to:

- **Track title** → links to the Spotify track (or a Spotify search as fallback)
- **Artist name** → links to a Spotify search for the artist
- **Album art** → links to the Spotify track page

Track URLs are resolved via the [ListenBrainz Labs API](https://labs.api.listenbrainz.org):
1. If the track has a MusicBrainz Recording ID (MBID), that is used for an exact lookup
2. Otherwise, artist name, track title, and album are used for a metadata-based lookup
3. If neither resolves, a Spotify search URL is used as a fallback

Resolved URLs are cached (30 days for direct track links, 4 hours for search fallbacks).

## Building

### Prerequisites
- **Recommended**: [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) (produces smaller binary size)
- **Alternative**: Standard Go 1.19+ (larger binary but easier setup)

### Quick Build (Using Makefile)
```sh
# Run tests
make test

# Build plugin.wasm
make build

# Create distributable plugin package
make package
```

The `make package` command creates `discord-rich-presence.ndp` containing the compiled WebAssembly module and manifest.

### Manual Build Options

#### Using TinyGo (Recommended)
```sh
# Install TinyGo first: https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/
tinygo build -target wasip1 -buildmode=c-shared -o plugin.wasm -scheduler=none .
zip discord-rich-presence.ndp plugin.wasm manifest.json
```

#### Using Standard Go
```sh
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugin.wasm .
zip discord-rich-presence.ndp plugin.wasm manifest.json
```

### Output
- `plugin.wasm`: The compiled WebAssembly module
- `discord-rich-presence.ndp`: The complete plugin package ready for installation
